LitElement Web Component generator is a minimal scaffold generator for Web Components with LitElement. It's still a work in progress and a little experiment using the [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/) to build and serve the component's demo. It uses some of the [open-wc](https://open-wc.org/) recommendations for unit testing and the included files in the package.

The CLI uses the [Oclif framework](https://oclif.io/) and other great tools like [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for the prompt and [Cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig) to allow the use of configuration files (`*rc`) and save the user preferences for the command.
