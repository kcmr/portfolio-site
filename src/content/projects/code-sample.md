`<code-sample>` is a Web Component to facilitate the inclusion of code fragments in web pages without the need of encoding entities, worring about spacing or script execution. It uses [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) library for syntax highlighting and includes several themes and the possibility of using a custom one.
