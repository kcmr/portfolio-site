This site has been built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) framework using a collection of technologies known as JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs and Markup).

Gatsby is a popular static site generator that uses React for the JavaScript templates and components and GraphQL to query the data from different sources, in this case, from markdown and static files.

The site also uses plugins to fit some of the requirements of a Progressive Web Application (offline support and a Web App Manifest), generate optimized images for different resolutions and optimized titles and meta-tags for SEO (discoverability).

Hosted and deployed with the zero config [Now by Zeit](https://zeit.co/).
